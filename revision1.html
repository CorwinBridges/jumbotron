              I had my first day of kindergarten. I was nervous to go but it
              turned out to be the start of an ongoing 13-year apocalypse! I
              don't remember it too well but I know it was a relaxed day. I
              hoped it stayed that way throughout my schooling, but it didnt't.

              I took a road trip from Jackson all the way to San Diego, CA. I
              went through Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. I
              spend about a week there and then had to ride all the way back
              home. I saw the Grand Canyon and Petrified Forest National Parks
              as well as some zoos, museums, and Meteor Crater!
            </td>
            <td>
              I flew from New York City to Barcelona, Spain. I stayed there for
              a few days and saw La Sagrada Familia. I then went aboard a cruise
              ship towards France and Italy. I saw Pompeii, the Leaning Tower of
              Pisa, and Rome! While I was in Rome, I visited the Vatican! I also
              visited Nice in France and had a tour there.
            </td>
            <td>
              I went to Governor's School for Computational Physics this summer
              where a learned (and forgot) a lot of new things! Although very
              basic, I learned how to code in Fortran. I also met a lot of
              interesting people from around Tennessee. It was a very hard class
              and I barely understood most of the things taught. I wouldn't have
              made it through without the amazing mentors that were always there
              to help us. It was a very memorable summer!
