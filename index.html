          <h2>Hanging out with my friends</h2>
          <p>
            I like to hang out with my friends on the weekend. I usually bike to
            their houses but sometimes I run. I like talking to them and getting
            away from my parents. We do fun things sometimes like go to a
            restaurant or go window shop.

          <h2>Cross Country</h2>
          <p>
            I like to run cross country. I get to progress along with other
            people. I also get to talk to friends and make new ones. We also try
            to help each other as much as possible so we can be better than we
            were before. Practice is my favorite part of the day.
